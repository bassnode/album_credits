Album Credits
=============
### Just because we listen to music digitally doesn't mean we shouldn't be able to access the album's liner notes.

Very much a work in progress but it's fairly functional.

      The packaging is the same as the EU version.

      Packaged in a translucent black slipcase over a unique stained jewel case.  The jewel case design is off centre from the typical US release.

      This pressing contains a typo on track 9 on both the Obi and the actual packaging.  The correct spelling is the same as the album title: "Lateralus."

      Recorded at:
      Cello Studios, Hollywood, CA
      The Hook, North Hollywood, CA
      Big Empty Space, North Hollywood, CA
      The Lodge, North Hollywood, CA

      Mixed at Larrabee Sound North, North Hollywood, CA.
      Mastered by Gateway Mastering Studios, Portland, ME.

TODO:
-----
* Cleanup code.  Was a hack turned gem...still needs lots of refactoring, comments and tests.
* Better identifying if a search result is *actually the album* being queried for.
* Add sources other than Discogs.com.
