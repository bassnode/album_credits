# Just because we listen to music digitally doesn't mean we shouldn't be able to access the album's liner notes.

Very much a work in progress.  Really just in a repo for safe keeping.  The idea is to eventually tie it into XBMC and maybe iTunes.
Usage:
    ruby engineering_data.rb "tool" "lateralus"

## Requirements
1. [Discogs gem](https://github.com/buntine/discogs.git)

## TODO:
*Better narrowing when provided mulitple release options. Perhaps by year/release type (remaster, etc)
*Better identifying if a search result is *actually the album* being queried for
*Add sources other than Discogs.com
